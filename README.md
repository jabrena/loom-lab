# Project Loom Learning Laboratory

A place to learn about [Project Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom) through hands-on
experimentation and exploration.

See more at [Project Site Pages](https://kolotyluk.github.io/loom-lab) 

My hope is to develop this into a learning tool for other people as well, so if you have ideas on how
this can work better for you or others, please create a ticket in
[loom-lab Issues](https://github.com/kolotyluk/loom-lab/issues).
People are encouraged to `clone` this repo, run the experiments
and other code, make local changes, and watch what happens.

I am happy to accept donations via
