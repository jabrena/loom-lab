/**
 * <h1>Experiment Suite 02</h1>
 * <p>
 *     This suite of experiments aims to get some basic practice with Futures that are based on Runnable and Callable
 *     tasks, so that as we explore further we have a good sense of how these work. The generic term 'task' is used
 *     to represent some unit of computation, generally concurrent computation. In the previous Experiments I used the
 *     term 'item' to represent the identity of a task...
