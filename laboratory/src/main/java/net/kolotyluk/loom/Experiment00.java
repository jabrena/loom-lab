/**
 * <h1>Simple loom-lab Experiment</h1>
 *  <p>
 *      This experiment is a quick way to jump into Project Loom, because we're here to 'il-loom-inate' things ðŸ˜‰
 *  </p>
 * <p>
 *     This is one of the most simple Project-Loom experiments that shows something interesting. When we run it we
 *     should see something like:
 * <pre>
 * item = 3, Thread ID = Thread[#1,main,5,main]
 * item = 4, Thread ID = Thread[#1,main,5,main]
 * item = 5, Thread ID = Thread[#1,main,5,main]
 *     task = 1, Thread ID = VirtualThread[#17]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2
 *     task = 0, Thread ID = VirtualThread[#15]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-9
 * item = 6, Thread ID = Thread[#1,main,5,main]
 * item = 7, Thread ID = Thread[#1,main,5,main]
 * </pre>
 *     Where we just print some information on which thread the code is running on; the indented lines were spawned
 *     by the unindented lines. While this is a very simple experiment, we will look at many of the new Project Loom
 *     bells and whistles, using the best new practices, so that we are well grounded for further experiments.
 *     <em>Feel free to ignore most of this for now, but remember it's here to get grounded again.</em>
 * </p>
 * <h1 style="padding-top: 16pt;">Virtual Threads</h1>
 * <p>
 *     In simple terms, <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8277131">Virtual Threads</a>
 *     are a new implementation of the classic Java Thread APIs, <em> <strong>but critically</strong>, a more
 *     efficient implementation.</em> Unlike Kotlin Coroutines, there are no language changes to support Project Loom.
 *     However, unlike Kotlin Coroutines, Virtual Threads are supported by new functionality in the JVM. Once Virtual
 *     Threads become stable and available, we should likely see a refactoring of many concurrency frameworks to use
 *     Virtual Threads, such as Kotlin Coroutines, Scala, Akka, Reactor and other Reactive frameworks.
 * </p>
 * <h1 style="padding-top: 16pt;">Structured Concurrency</h1>
 * <p>
 *     In addition to Virtual Threads, one of the important new features Project-Loom brings to JDK-18 is
 *     <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8277129">Structured Concurrency</a>
 *     In a nutshell, Structured Concurrency is like eliminating <tt>goto</tt> in old style programming languages,
 *     creating better discipline in how we fork and join, keeping all such concurrency in a hierarchy of parents
 *     and children, or sessions and sub-sessions.
 *     <blockquote>
 *         <em>When the flow of execution splits into multiple concurrent flows, they rejoin in the same code block.</em>
 *     </blockquote>
 *     {@link StructuredExecutor} is the heart of Structured Concurrency which is designed to work with
 *     try-with-resources blocks, where the {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} resource is closed at the
 *     end of the block. {@link StructuredExecutor#open(String)} opens a '<em>Session</em>' which implies a lifecycle
 *     and lifetime. The lifecycle is best described as
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Get an ExecutorService instance and open a session, which starts the lifecycle of that session.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Define a Completion Handler from one of
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>StructuredExecutor.ShutdownOnFailure()</li>
 *             <li>StructuredExecutor.ShutdownOnSuccess()</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         each of which initiates the shutdown of the whole family of forked tasks... children, children of children,
 *         etc. These are also known as Completion Policies, and there could be other policies in the future.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Use {@link StructuredExecutor#fork(Callable, BiConsumer)} to fork (spawn) tasks according to the
 *         ThreadFactory in {@link StructuredExecutor#open(String,ThreadFactory)}. If not specified, the default is
 *         Virtual Threads. {@link BiConsumer} the Completion Handler.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link StructuredExecutor#join()} to wait for the lifecycles of all the spawned tasks to complete. Note,
 *         if these child tasks spawn their own tasks, those lifecycles must also complete.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Handle Execution Failures, such as with <tt>StructuredExecutor.ShutdownOnFailure.throwIfFailed();</tt>
 *         Basically, we need to deal with this before the try-with-resources block implicitly calls close() in
 *         the <tt>finally</tt> stage, because try-with-resources is not flexible enough to handle this situation.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Close the StructuredExecutor resource implicitly, finally completing its lifetime.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * <h1 style="padding-top: 16pt;">Conclusions</h1>
 * <p>
 *     The StructuredExecutor we create here is a 'child' node of the Thread running, and each child that is forked
 *     becomes a child node of the StructuredExecutor. In this way, we can manage all forked threads as a group in
 *     a well-disciplined way. In a sense, the StructuredExecutor and the Thread it is opened from, are the parents
 *     of the sibling tasks that are spawned. In short, Project Loom is an attempt to make Concurrent Families less
 *     dysfunctional... ðŸ˜‰

 *         Tasks may be mapped 1:1 to Threads, or they may just be executed sequentially by threads in a
 *         Thread Pool, and that is determined by the implementation of the Executor. For example, in
 *         {@link ForkJoinPool} each Thread may execute many Tasks; when they complete one Task, they can
 *         execute the next scheduled Task. A task completes with a result, an exception, or it is cancelled.

 *     <dt>Completion</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         When using the 2-arg fork method then the onComplete operation is invoked when the task completes,

 *     <dt>Completion Handlers</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Completion handlers allows us to factor out policies for the common and simple cases where we need to
 *         collect results or shutdown the executor session based on the taskâ€™s success or failure. A call to shutdown
 *         indicates that the computation is done â€” either successfully or unsuccessfully â€” and so thereâ€™s no point
 *         in processing further results. In more complicated â€” and, we believe, much rarer â€” cases, like the connection
 *         example in the javadoc, the completion handler is, indeed, insufficient, and weâ€™d want to do cleanup
 *         processing inside the task and possibly call shutdown directly.
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>{@link Future}</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         The object returned as a result of {@link StructuredExecutor#fork(Callable, BiConsumer)}. Can be used to
 *         interrogate the state of the running task, get the result, etc.
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>Interrupt</dt>
 *     <dd>Threads can be interrupted, invited to end prematurely, but they cannot be forced to end prematurely.</dd>
 *     <dt>Cancel</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         {@link Future#cancel(boolean)} is used to
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>Shutdown</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         <em>Shutdown is the concurrent execution analogue to a <tt>break</tt> statement in sequential loop.</em>
 *         The {@link StructuredExecutor#shutdown()} method is for cases where we've got an interesting
 *         result and we're no longer interested in the results of other tasks. The
 *         shutdown method closes the front door to prevent new threads from
 *         starting. It also interrupts the threads that are running the tasks that
 *         haven't completed yet. It also tries to make it clear that when shutdown
 *         completes that are tasks are "done" (it links to Future::isDone). You
 *         shouldn't need to use Future::get with this API but if you were then you
 *         should see that Future::get wakes up when SE::shutdown is called.
