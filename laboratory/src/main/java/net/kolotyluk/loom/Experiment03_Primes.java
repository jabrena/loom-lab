 * TODO - Experiment with Java Flow
 * <h1>Experiment 3 - Prime Numbers</h1>
 * <p>
 *     Calculating Prime Numbers is always fun, and it's most fun when we try to compute prime numbers as
 *     fast as possible, or as many at once as we can. As we will see, Project Loom offers us no benefits in this
 *     <em>use case</em>, but it's interesting to experiment and see why.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     As I have mentioned before, with Concurrent Programming, higher levels of abstraction are generally better
 *     and safer because they have been designed and implemented by experts, and <em>it's better to stand on the
 *     shoulders of giants</em>. Generally, for CPU Bound use cases, the {@link java.util.stream.Stream} Interface
 *     is a good place to start as it has been specifically design for such use cases.
 * </p>
 * <hr>
 * <h2>Streams</h2>
 * <p>
 *     The Streams Architecture has three important phases
 *     <dl>
 *         <dt>Source</dt>
 *         <dd>Something that generates a stream of objects, such as a range of numbers, in our case,
 *             numbers that could be prime</dd>
 *         <dt>Pipeline</dt>
 *         <dd>A sequence of Functions on each object in the stream, in our case, testing if a number is prime,
 *             which leverages the {@link Stream#filter(Predicate)} function.</dd>
 *         <dt>Sink</dt>
 *         <dd>Ultimately, we need somewhere to <em>Collect</em> the Stream of objects. This is also known
 *             as *Terminating* the Stream.</dd>
 *     </dl>
 *     Note: Unlike <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html">Akka Streams</a>,
 *     Java Streams are not Infinite, they must terminate, and indeed, the Pipeline does not start until
 *     it is actually terminated with some collection function. The Java {@link Flow} is more akin to
 *     Akka Streams, and in Akka Streams, they actually use the term <em>Flow</em>. Hopefully later we
 *     can see the effects of running Java Flows with Project Loom...
 *     <blockquote>
 *         There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
 *         <strong><em>naming things</em></strong>.
 *         <p>â€” Phil Karlton</p>
 *     </blockquote>
 *     As we can see in {@link Experiment03_Primes#serialPrimes(long)} it is very easy to express taking a range
 *     of numbers, and filtering out the primes. From {@link Experiment03_Primes#parallelPrimes(long)} we can see
 *     how easy it is to change this to parallel computation. However, with some experimentation, we can easily
 *     see that unless we have a large set of computations, 10,000 or more, making the computations parallel
 *     does not really buy us much. This is because the overhead of Concurrent Operation can easily overwhelm
 *     any benefits of parallelism.
 * </p>
 * <hr>
 * <h2>Threads</h2>
 * <p>
 *     For the rest of the experiments, we can conclude that that attempts to use Threads to do better than basic
 *     {@link Stream#parallel()} generally fail. We can also see that the code is substantially more
 *     complicated too...
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     However, where threads really shine is when we are dealing with concurrency where there are a lot of blocking
 *     operations, such as transaction processing, network access, etc. Every blocking operation is an opportunity for
 *     some other task to run and progress.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     For these experiments we warp our primes experiments into a pseudo networking application, where we simulate
 *     farming isPrime() out to HTTP Endpoints. This simulation basically wraps the
 *     {@link Experiment03_Primes#isPrime(long, long, long)} calculation with network latency via
 *     {@link Thread#sleep(long)}, one to simulate Request Latency, another to simulate Response
 *     Latency.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     <strong><em>As we will see, using Virtual Threads over Platform Threads gives us about 20 times the
 *     throughput in operations</em></strong> (for this specific use case). This throughput, however, is not
 *     measured explicitly, but inferred because Platform Threads takes about 20 times longer than Virtual
 *     Threads to check the same number of primes. This might be a bit like comparing oranges to grapefruit,
 *     but they're both citrus.
 * TODO - devise better throughput experiments
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The spirit of the experiments here is that we might have some application that is computationally expensive and
 *     takes a long time. While {@link Stream#parallel()} works just fine on limited scale, we might imagine a magic
 *     cloud that has some <tt>/isPrime</tt> endpoints where the work can be done faster, more efficiently, etc. Indeed,
 *     this is a classic
 *     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a>
 *     model. To be sure, if we really wanted to generate prime numbers in a
 *     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_technical_computing">High-Performance Computing</a>
 *     style, we might use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark">Apache Spark</a>,
 *     but here we are trying to keep things simple, and make a point, not a perfect application.
